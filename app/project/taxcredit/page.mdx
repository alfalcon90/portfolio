TaxCredit.ai is a fintech product built by [Zagaran](https://zagaran.com) that helps startups claim a R&D Tax Credit. The tools uses AI to classify data pulled from git repos which is then used to generate all the paperwork necessary to file the tax claim.

## Marketing website

This project was actually two separate projects. The first project was redesigning the marketing website and a rebranding from Retroacdev to TaxCredit.ai. The most challenging part of this project was building the tax calculator as a separate React component that could then be embedded into a Framer project. Some of the 3D illustrations were also a bit of a struggle, since I hadn’t used Cinema4D for a few years at that point and had mostly forgotten how lighting and rendering works.

## Web application

The second project was doing the same sort of rebranding and redesign but for the actual product which is built with Django and React. After building a new design system and a few of the key pages of the app I was tasked with implementing the designs. Even though I had never built anything with Django or Python before I was able to hit the ground running and figure stuff out as I went.

Something cool that I did for this project was build the design system in such a way that the primary and background colors could be changed by a user and everything would still look good.
