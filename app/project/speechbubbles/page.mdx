I designed and built [speechbubbles.care](https://speechbubbles.care) for the best client Iâ€™ve ever worked with: my wife! We worked on it for a month or so, thoughtfully picking everything together from the colors and fonts to the logo and copy. This project was a great opportunity to learn some new tools like [TinaCMS](https://tina.io/) and try out image generation using Midjourney. TinaCMS was particularly fun to use and wire up, allowing my wife to independently update all the content on the site without touching any code.
