Tinytown is a hyperlocal chat app that I've been working on since 2020. As a solo founder, the work I've done on Tinytown encompasses all areas of business and product development -- from legal and marketing to design and engineering. The start of this project marks the beginning of my journey in becoming a software engineer. Most of what I’ve learned in the past 5 years about software development has been with the purpose of building Tinytown.

The web and mobile apps are built using Flutter while the backend consists of a few microservices built with Rust + Axum and SurrealDB. To tie it all together I’m using gRPC and protobuf following the [Google API design guide](https://cloud.google.com/apis/design).
