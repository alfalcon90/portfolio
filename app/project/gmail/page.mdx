In 2018, under pressure to catch up with Slack and Microsoft Teams, Google went through a major reorganization to position Gmail as a new contender in the enterprise comms space. Our small Google Keep team was one of the teams affected by this reorganization, so for the next two years I spent a lot of time thinking about the future of email and async communication tools.
