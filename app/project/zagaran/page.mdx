In 2022 I began doing contract work for Zagaran, a software development agency based in Boston, MA. The first project we worked on together was a complete redesign of their marketing website.

We kicked off the project with a set of vignettes for possible directions that the team could choose from. This allowed me to quickly zero in on a treatment that we felt best represented Zagaran as a company and rule out those that were way off the mark.

Once we picked a general direction, we did another round of explorations focused on one design treatment.

From there we continued to dial in the treatment and branding based on their feedback until we landed on the designs shown below.
