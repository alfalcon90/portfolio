In 2022 I had the chance to help some friends from Google start a new hardware company. [Quilt](https://www.quilt.com/) is a smart mini-split system that provides room-by-room heating and cooling while combining energy efficiency with elegant interior design. I helped develop the first version of their mobile app and created Flutter prototypes to explore solutions for complex UX challenges the team faced at the time.
