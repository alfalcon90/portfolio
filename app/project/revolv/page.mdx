# Revolv

<ProjectDetail title="Role" description="UX Designer" />
<ProjectDetail title="Time" description="2013 â†” 2014" />
<ProjectDetail title="Tools" description="Photoshop, After Effects, InDesign" />

I was the first and only designer at Revolv for most of 2013 so I had the chance to do everything from UX and web design to packaging and industrial design. I designed the iOS and Android apps as well as the marketing website, and packaging for the Revolv hub.

### About Revolv

[Revolv](https://revolv.com/) was an IoT startup based in Boulder, CO that built a small hub that would help you connect all your smart home devices together under one app. The company was acquired by Google/Nest in 2014.

### The work

Due to the nature of the Google acquisition much of the work I did is locked away at some Google server in an unknown location. Luckily, a few Dribbble shots and videos are still around of some of the work I did.

A brief look at our out-of-box experience. I designed all the screens shown here but I'm most proud of the Portal reference shown at 1:09 ðŸŽ‚.
