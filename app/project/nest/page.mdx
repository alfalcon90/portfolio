## Nest x Yale Lock

After being acquired in 2014 by Google + Nest, our team was put in charge of designing and bringing the Next x Yale Lock to market.

### Hardware UX

I led the UX design work for the lock and its out-of-box experience, working closely with hardware engineers in California and South Korea.

### App UX

I was the lead designer on the project tasked with adding support for the Next x Yale lock inside the Nest app, which included the pairing and device control UX as well as features like History and Family & Guests.

## Nest Shield

As part of my work for the Nest x Yale Lock, I helped develop a framework (named Nest Shield internally) for showing users how secure their home is based on signals like device state, user presence, and time of day.

## Google Home

During my time at Nest I also designed an expandable and modular system of UI elements to support third-party devices that later became the foundation for the design patterns used in the Google Home app. The goal was to be able to support any kind of home product in the Google Home app by declarative rendering device controls based off a schema describing the capabilities of the device. This project would later inform the work that went into [Matter](https://developers.home.google.com/matter/overview), the industry’s new standard for connecting home devices.
