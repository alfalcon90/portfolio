This is a marketing website I designed and built for my brother-in-law, Jason Shafer. Jason is the [Principal Clarinetist](https://coloradosymphony.org/musician/shafer-jason/) for the Colorado Symphony so the style I picked for the website is very much influenced by the fine detail and craftsmanship of the wind instruments used by classical musicians like Jason.
