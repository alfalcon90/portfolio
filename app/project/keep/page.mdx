After four years of working in the IoT space at Nest, I wanted to explore a new domain and decided to join the [Keep](https://google.com/keep) team at Google. I had always been huge fan of Google Keep and it felt like a privilege to be able to help shape a product that a lot of people use as an extension of their brain. In addition to shipping the features shown below I spent a lot of time there working closely together with Product and Engineering leads on defining a long-term vision and roadmap for Keep. This work is still being used today at Google to help inform product strategy for productivity tools.
